# SapienAI - Nexus of Mankind

**SapienAI** - Bridging AI with the study of human sapiens across biology, science, technology, and more.

## Overview

SapienAI is an ambitious project dedicated to leveraging artificial intelligence to explore, understand, and predict aspects of human existence. This repository hosts the core codebase for AI agents and tools developed to aid in research on human biology, physics, technology integration, ethical considerations, and existential questions.

## Project Goals

- **Research:** Use AI to dive deep into human-related scientific domains.
- **Education:** Share findings and methodologies with the community to foster learning and discussion.
- **Innovation:** Develop new AI-driven tools that can assist in various scientific inquiries.

## Solana Blockchain Expansion Research

The crypto side was optional and simply to push the idea further to fund the research of SapienAI

- **Name:** SapienAI
- **Token:** $SAPIEN
- **Blockchain:** Solana
- **Official CA:** Coming soon!
